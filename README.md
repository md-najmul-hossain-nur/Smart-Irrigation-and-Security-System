# ðŸŒ± Smart Irrigation and Security System

This project is an Arduino-based smart automation system that combines **plant irrigation** and **home security** features. The system intelligently waters plants based on soil moisture levels and monitors motion near the system for basic security alerts. It also displays real-time sensor data on an LCD display and in the Serial Monitor.

## ðŸ”„ System Workflow

1. The system reads soil moisture.
2. If **Soil = Dry** and **Tank = Not Empty** â†’ Pump ON.
3. If **Soil = Wet** or **Tank = Empty** â†’ Pump OFF.
4. PIR sensor detects motion â†’ Trigger buzzer security alert.
5. DHT11 tracks room temperature and humidity.
6. LCD continuously displays:
   - Soil Moisture Status
   - Temperature & Humidity
   - Water Tank Level
   - Motion Detection Status
7. Same data also prints on Serial Monitor.
